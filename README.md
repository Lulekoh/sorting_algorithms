#Tasks descriptions
0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
//Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line://
1. Insertion sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
//Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line://
2. Selection sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
//Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line://
3. Quick sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
